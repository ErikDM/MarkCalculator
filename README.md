# MarkCalculator

This program is created to calculate your mark during the PBL course at Noroff Education. The calculator is designed to calculate your total mark based on your score on TAPs, Online Test and Assessment week. Only 12/15 TAPs are counted as points, since 4/5 are obligated.

The calculator has been implemented with number adjustments, which means that if you type in 15 TAPs done, the calculator will only give you points for 12 TAPs. Entering for example 150 points on your assessment week will be automatically adjusted down to 100. The same goes for TAPs and Online Test. All limits exceeded will automatically adjust your score to "maximum".

Feel free to contact me about new features, adjustments, bugs and so on.
